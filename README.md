# TODO

* Check performance! 100% CPU usage for a simple tetris game is not acceptable :D
* Choose programming language. Can it be done in less amount of code in
  coffeescript?
* Change the colors, brown is ugly
* Add mainmenu
* Add highscore
* Pimp up the index.html
* Add "next stone" display
* Add "score" display
* Game over screen
* Make archive, check size, submit :P
